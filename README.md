-Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?

  Artemis Financial is a financial services company that handles sensitive financial data for its clients. They wanted to improve the security of their software to protect against potential data breaches and ensure their clients’ financial information was safe. My job was to find any weaknesses in their software and help make it more secure.

-What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?

  One of the things I did well was carefully assessing the code to locate any vulnerabilities, especially those related to data encryption and secure communication. I identified where sensitive data might be at risk and implemented security measures to protect it. Secure coding is important because it protects user data from being stolen or misused by attackers. For companies like Artemis Financial, strong software security builds trust with customers and prevents financial losses due to security breaches, making the company more stable and respected.

-Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

  A challenging part of the vulnerability assessment was learning to spot different types of vulnerabilities and deciding on the best way to fix them. However, this process was also very helpful because it taught me how to approach security issues methodically. Understanding the different layers of security needed for financial data was both challenging and a valuable learning experience.

-How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

  I added layers of security by implementing SHA-256 encryption to securely hash sensitive data and by ensuring data was sent over HTTPS. This added multiple checks that made unauthorized access much harder. In the future, I would use tools like static analysis software, which scans code for security issues, and vulnerability assessment tools, which test how the software might be attacked. These tools would help me quickly identify risks and choose the right solutions to strengthen security.

-How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

  I ensured the code was functional by running extensive tests, both functional and security-focused, to confirm that the software worked as intended and was secure. After refactoring, I used these tests again to verify that no new issues had been introduced. I also reviewed the code with a focus on security to make sure all changes maintained or improved security.

-What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

  I used Java Keytool to generate certificates for secure connections and applied SHA-256 hashing to protect sensitive data. Consistent code reviews, using static code analysis, and focusing on secure coding practices helped me create a secure final product. These tools and practices will be very useful in future projects, especially when working with sensitive data.

-Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

  I would show future employers this project as an example of my ability to find and fix security issues in software. It shows I can secure data, follow industry practices for encryption and secure communication, and work through vulnerability assessments. This assignment would demonstrate my skills in secure coding and my understanding of security protocols, which are important in any software development job.
